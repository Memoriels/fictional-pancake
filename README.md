## Introduction

Are you ready to dive into the wonderful world of Angular and create a website that will (hopefully) impress our professors and secure us that A+? Of course, weâ€™ll also sprinkle in a bit of fun along the way because who said coding had to be boring?

## Setup & Installation

Before we start our journey, let's set up our environment. Think of it as packing your backpack for a long, adventurous hike.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed. If not, hereâ€™s a magical command to do the trick:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Clone the Repository

Grab your copy of this awesome project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DoubelT/fictional-pancake.git
cd angular-university-project
npm install
```

You're now all set to start coding like a wizard!

## Development Guide

### Serving the App

To see your creation in action, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Then open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser. VoilÃ ! Your Angular app is up and running. ðŸŽ‰

### Building the App

When youâ€™re ready to show off your masterpiece:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

This will create a `dist/` directory with all the production-ready files. Hand it in, cross your fingers, and hope for the best!

## Project Structure

Here's a quick tour of our project. Think of it as a guided tour through a museum of code artifacts.

Letâ€™s make this project the best thing since sliced breadâ€¦ or at least since the last project we turned in!

## FAQ

### Q: Why Angular?
A: Because it's trendy, and the professor loves it. Plus, it makes us look cool.

### Q: My code isnâ€™t working, help!
A: Try turning it off and on again. If that doesnâ€™t work, consult the all-knowing Stack Overflow.

### Q: Can I use jQuery?
A: Only if you want to face the wrath of our Angular-loving professor.

### Q: What's the deadline?
A: Yesterday. Just kidding, check the syllabus or ask the professor for the most accurate panic-inducing date.
